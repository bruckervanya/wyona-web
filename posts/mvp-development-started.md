The prototype of Katie is working successfully. We have now started the development of Katie as Minimum Viable Product.
<br><br/>
For the next few months we are focusing on:<br><br/>

- Quality of answers
- Ease of use (UI/UX)
- Design
- Full automation
- Scalability and performance
- Multilingualism<br><br/>

We have developed a **Go-to-market** strategy and will be testing it by doing various PoCs as soon as the MVP will be ready.
<br><br/>
Please contact us if you would like to discuss Katie in more detail or would be interested to do a PoC with Katie.
